# City Pop Stack

Based on [Remix Grunge Stack](https://github.com/remix-run/grunge-stack). Learn more about [Remix Stacks](https://remix.run/stacks).

```
npx create-remix@latest --template daryl-sf/city-pop-stack
```

## What's in the stack

- [AWS deployment](https://aws.com) with [Architect](https://arc.codes/)
- Production-ready [DynamoDB Database](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
- [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) for deploy on merge to production and staging environments
- Email/Password Authentication with [cookie-based sessions](https://remix.run/utils/sessions#createcookiesessionstorage)
- DynamoDB access via [`arc.tables`](https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/runtime-helpers/node.js#arc.tables)
- Styling with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Local third party request mocking with [MSW](https://mswjs.io)
- Unit testing with [Vitest](https://vitest.dev) and [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com)
- Code formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org)
- Static Types with [TypeScript](https://typescriptlang.org)

Not a fan of bits of the stack? Fork it, change it, and use `npx create-remix --template your/repo`! Make it your own.

## Development

- First run this stack's `remix.init` script and commit the changes it makes to your project.

  ```sh
  npx remix init
  git init # if you haven't already
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initialize project"
  ```

- Validate the app has been set up properly (optional):

  ```sh
  npm run validate
  ```

- Start dev server:

  ```sh
  npm run dev
  ```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

This Remix Stack comes with two GitHub Actions that handle automatically deploying your app to production and staging environments. By default, Arc will deploy to the `us-west-2` region, if you wish to deploy to a different region, you'll need to change your [`app.arc`](https://arc.codes/docs/en/reference/project-manifest/aws)

Prior to your first deployment, you'll need to do a few things:

- Create a new [GitHub repo](https://repo.new)

- [Sign up](https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup#/start) and login to your AWS account

- Add `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` to [your GitHub repo's secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets). Go to your AWS [security credentials](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home?region=us-west-2#/security_credentials) and click on the "Access keys" tab, and then click "Create New Access Key", then you can copy those and add them to your repo's secrets.

- Install the [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html#getting-started-install-instructions).

- Create an [AWS credentials file](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-quickstart.html#getting-started-quickstart-new).

- Along with your AWS credentials, you'll also need to give your CloudFormation a `SESSION_SECRET` variable of its own for both staging and production environments, as well as an `ARC_APP_SECRET` for Arc itself.

  ```sh
  npx arc env --add --env staging ARC_APP_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 32)
  npx arc env --add --env staging SESSION_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 32)
  npx arc env --add --env production ARC_APP_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 32)
  npx arc env --add --env production SESSION_SECRET $(openssl rand -hex 32)
  ```

  If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator) to generate a random secret, just replace `$(openssl rand -hex 32)` with the generated secret.

## Where do I find my CloudFormation?

You can find the CloudFormation template that Architect generated for you in the sam.yaml file.

To find it on AWS, you can search for [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home) (make sure you're looking at the correct region!) and find the name of your stack (the name is a PascalCased version of what you have in `app.arc`, so by default it's CityPopStackStaging and CityPopStackProduction) that matches what's in `app.arc`, you can find all of your app's resources under the "Resources" tab.

## GitHub Actions

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. Anything that gets into the `main` branch will be deployed to production after running tests/build/etc. Anything in the `dev` branch will be deployed to staging.

## Testing

### Vitest

For lower level tests of utilities and individual components, we use `vitest`. We have DOM-specific assertion helpers via [`@testing-library/jest-dom`](https://testing-library.com/jest-dom).

### Type Checking

This project uses TypeScript. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor to get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete. To run type checking across the whole project, run `npm run typecheck`.

### Linting

This project uses ESLint for linting. That is configured in `.eslintrc.js`.

### Formatting

We use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in this project. It's recommended to install an editor plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)) to get auto-formatting on save. There's also a `npm run format` script you can run to format all files in the project.
